(1) BATTERY POLARITY should be reversed given the batteries I have for the PH2 connector.
Made explicit whether it's adafruit style or not.

(2) I2C Screen is working well-- need to be able to hit the reset on it maybe.  Expose reset pin and maybe make it usable by MCU

(3) pullups don't seem to be required, at least for screen.

(4) Label for header connecting LED pins (clock and data) not labeled well.

BUTTONS

buttons working. Internal pull ups required.
HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_1)

VIBRATION MOTOR

For Nucleo to output on PA8 (CN10 pin 25) TIM1 to Clock Source = Internal Clock, Channel 1 = PWM Generation CH1, Counter Prescaler = 100, Counter Period = 20, Internal Clock Division = No division.  PWM Generation Channel 1 Pulse=10, Fast Mode=Enable.  

Runs off APB2 Timer Clock, (32Mhz)/Prescaler (0) is one counter tick.

Counter Period = 100, Internal Clock Division 4

PWM working -- need to set up TIM and CH in CUBE, including the counter (100) and time_divs (4).
Set the output pin to match that TIM_CH (here we use timer 3 and channel 2).
if (HAL_TIM_PWM_Start(&htim1, TIM_CHANNEL_1) != HAL_OK) {
	Error_Handler();
}
int duty_cycle = 0;
while(1){
htim1.Instance->CCR1 = duty_cycle;
duty_cycle = (duty_cycle+1)%20;
HAL_Delay(500);
}

Vibration motor also has internal drive IC, can just turn on and off.

Pullup, High output level.  HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_8);

OLED SCREEN

working with included libraries.  Could breakout reset pin (definitely should for easy access)
Doesn't need 3.7V to work.  
Right now the I2C communication is done in polling mode and with
individual commands broken out for setup; this could be accelerated by batching all
commands and using an interrupt based approach.

LEDS

working with DotStar arduino library.  Ported over.  Works with 3.7V rail and 3.3V logic.

SPI seems quite slow, should be much faster if we use larger buffers.  Right now it's one byte at a time.
Clock could be up to 8MHz no problem and is at 1MHz at the moment.
